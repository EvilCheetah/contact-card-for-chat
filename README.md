# ReactJS Contact Card For Chat

This was the first project to get my feet wet with the HTML and CSS using ReactJS. This visualization was written mainly to select the colors for the type; however, was also used as a playground to figure out how flex, margins, paddings, etc. actually work.

If you just want to take a look at he final result, i.e. deployed version, go to the [**Demo | GitHub Pages**](https://evilcheetah.github.io/reactjs-conversation-card/).

## How to Run

Before running the project, make sure the dependencies are installed.
In order to do that, run `pnpm i`.

To test the app builds, run `pnpm run build`.
To view the visualization, run `pnpm start`.
