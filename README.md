# ReactJS Contact Card For Chat

This was the first project to get my feet wet with the HTML and CSS using ReactJS. This visualization was written mainly to select the colors for the type; however, was also used as a playground to figure out how flex, margins, paddings, etc. actually work.

In order to do that, run `npm i`.
